        <h3>Visit Yemen</h3>
        <p>
          <strong> Maʾrib, also spelled Marib, town and historic site</strong>,
          north-central Yemen. It is famous as the location of the ancient
          fortified city of Maʾrib and its associated dam, principal centre of
          the pre-Islamic state of Sabaʾ (950–115 BCE). Sabaean civilization
          reached its peak with the transfer of power from the mukarribs
          (priest-kings) to autocratic monarchs (7th century BCE). The ancient
          city, in a fertile oasis irrigated by the impounded waters of the
          Maʾrib Dam, has been called “the Paris of the ancient world.” It was
          on one of the principal caravan routes that linked the Mediterranean
          world and the Arabian Peninsula, and it prospered especially because
          of its trading monopoly of frankincense and myrrh from Yemen and the
          southern coastal region of Hadhramaut.

          <strong> The Amiriya Madrasa in Rada</strong>,one of the largest
          monuments in Yemen, was commissioned by Sultan 'Amir bin abd al-Wahab
          of the Tahirid Dynasty ; All in all, the 'Amiriya is the most
          flamboyantly ornate monument in the Yemen, a profusion of domes,
          arches, and niches on the outside, and a decorated delight on the
          inside, with superb carved stucco patterns and inscriptions and
          extraordinary painted frescoes whose colors were still vibrant, even
          after 500 years of neglect ; The physical restoration of the building
          has now been completed, its infrastructure services have been
          upgraded, a site museum has been installed on the ground floor, the
          carved stucco decoration in the prayer hall has been cleaned, and the
          mural paintings inside the prayer hall's six domes have been conserved
          by the Italian firm CCA .

            >Al-Hutaib village is located at an altitude of up to 3,200
            meters</strong
          >
          above the surface of the earth, the atmosphere around the village is
          actually quite warm and moderate. During the winter, the atmosphere is
          very cold in the early morning, but as soon as the sun rises, a warm
          and beautiful climate takes over. Visitors of the village are often
          dazzled by the sight of fog slowly crawling to embrace Hutaib as the
          houses hang on the chests of the mountains, making the scenery for one
          rare artistic masterpiece.

          The photos of the famed hill-top houses of Hutaib village near Sanaa
          are real, with real families who live most of their lives cultivating
          the lands around the mountains while living above the clouds during
          the winter seasons.Hutain is located in the Haraz inside the
          mountainous district of Manakhah, west of the capital Sanaa. Visitors
          usually visit the village to admire the tops of the mountains where
          hundreds of houses have been built over the years.

          <strong>Aden is the largest city of southern part of Yemen.</strong
          >Aden is the largest city of southern Yemen. It is also the
          administrative centre of the Aden governorate. At the time of writing,
          Aden was the internationally recognized capital of Yemen and recent
          developments regarding efforts to separate Aden as an independent city
          in Yemen have not been incorporated in the analysis. This proﬁle
          describes and analyses the situation in the city of Aden across a
          variety of sectors. It addresses key themes and ﬁndings made prominent
          by the impact of the ongoing conflict, its toll on the city’s
          population, and ability of institutions to provide basic services.
          Each thematic section study the prevailing situation and needs through
          triangulation of data, including: secondary data analysis which draws
          on available publications and media reports; remote sensing; and
          structured interviews with community focal points (CFP) and sector
          experts (see section 2: Methodology). The aim of the proﬁle is to
          provide humanitarian partners with a granular understanding of
          multi-sector needs in Aden, assisting them in their operational
          programming and strategic policy development
