      <h3>Visit Sana'a</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Dar Al-Hajar (Rock Palace)</strong> .. Located in northwest
        of Sana'a in the middle of Wadi Dhahr, 25 km away from the city
        center. The first mention of Wadi Dhahr was in the seventh century
        B.C. as it was inhabited by prehistoric people.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is the most popular symbol of Yemen seen on posters and in
        magazines. The fame of the valley goes back many ages ago, as
        indicated by drawings found on the valley rocks, which led
        archeologists to conclude that the valley was inhabited before
        recorded history. The rock palace was built by al-Imam Mansour,
        dating back to 1786. Bayt Baws. It was once an old Jewish community
        situated on a huge protruding rock. Its ridges were carved by the
        people in the past for fortification. The only way in and plausible
        way out is a wide wooded Gate that gives access to this deserted
        village.<a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/385"

        Currently, the building houses a museum. This pattern of Yemeni
        architecture is a seven-storey building with 35 rooms, pantries and
        kitchens. Around the palace there are five ruined watch towers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The Great Mosque of Sana'a</strong> is an ancient mosque in
        Sana'a, Yemen, and one of the oldest mosques in the world. The
        mosque has been founded in the early Islamic period, suggested to be
        in 633. While the precise date of construction is unknown, the
        earliest recorded renovations occurred under Caliph al-Walid I in
        the early 8th century, implying a possible earlier date of
        construction. The mosque was reportedly built in part from spolia
        from the Himyarite-era Ghumdan. The Great Mosque is the largest and
        most notable of over one hundred mosques in the Old City of
        Sanaâ€™a..The building has undergone renovations in the 8th century,
        the 13th century, and the Ottoman period.

      <p>
        <strong>The Old City of Sana'a</strong> , situated in a mountain
        valley at an altitude of 2,200 m, the Old City of Sana'a is defined
        by an extraordinary density of rammed earth and burnt brick towers
        rising several stories above stone-built ground floors, strikingly
        decorated with geometric patterns of fired bricks and white gypsum.
        The ochre of the building blends into the bistre-colored earth of
        the nearby mountains. Within the city, minarets pierce the skyline
        and spacious green bustans (gardens) are scattered between the
        densely packed houses, mosques, bath buildings, and caravanserais.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inhabited for more than 2,500 years, the city was given official
        status in the second century BC when it was an outpost of the
        Yemenite kingdoms. By the first century AD, it emerged as a center
        of the inland trade route.
      </p>
      <p>The protection of the Old City of Sana'a is ensured by the Antiquities Law of 1997 as well as the Building Law of 2002. Protection will be improved when the Historical Cities Preservation Law comes into force. The preparation of a Conservation Plan, and of an exhaustive inventory of buildings of the city and its surroundings have been completed. The General Organization for the Preservation of the Historic Cities of Yemen (GOPHCY) aims to develop the Conservation Plan in the next few years. It is also proposed to establish a Conservation Unit to involve all stakeholders, who will be encouraged to participate in the preparation of the city Management Plan process. GOPHCY, established in 1990, is an independent body set up to create an appropriate strategy for sustainable development. After the new Law enters into force, it will become the overall authority for management of the World Heritage property.

        In its decision concerning inscription, the World Heritage Committee "recommended that an adequate buffer zone should be established around the old city." This recommendation should be implemented in order to improve the protection of the property which also needs clearly defined boundaries.</p>
