        <h3>Visit Shibam</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Shibam, which is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site</strong> ,
          is known for its distinct architecture. The houses of Shibam are all
          made out of mudbrick, and about 500 of them are tower blocks, which
          rise 5 to 11 stories high.Architectural style was used in order to
          protect residents from Bedouin attacks.While Shibam has been in
          existence for an estimated 1,700 years, most of the city's houses
          originate from the 16th century. Shibam is often called "the oldest
          skyscraper city in the world It is one of the oldest and best examples
          of urban planning based on the principle of vertical construction.The
          city has some of the tallest mud buildings in the world, with some of
          them over 30 m (98 feet) high,thus being early high-rise apartment
          buildings.<a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/192/"

            >The first known inscription about the city dates from the 3rd
            century CE</strong
          >.It was the capital of the Hadramawt Kingdom. In the 20th century, it
          was one of the three major cities of the Qu'aiti Sultanate, the others
          being Al-Mukalla and Ash-Shihr.The city was added to the UNESCO World
          Heritage List in 1982.In 2008, a tropical cyclone flooded
          Shibam.During the Yemen Civil War, the city suffered some damage after
          insurgents detonated a car bomb.There was also coalition bombing in
          the area. In 2015, UNESCO listed the city as "cultural heritage at
          risk"

          (UNESCO) designates World Heritage Sites of outstanding universal
          value to cultural or natural heritage which have been nominated by
          countries which are signatories to the UNESCO World Heritage
          Convention, established in 1972.[1] Cultural heritage consists of
          monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or
          inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including
          archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and
          biological formations), geological and physiographical formations
          (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and
          natural sites which are important from the point of view of science,
          conservation or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage.

            >The protection of the Old City of Shibam is ensured by the
            Antiquities Law of 1997 as well as the building law of 2002</strong
          >. Protection will be improved when the Historical Cities Preservation
          Law comes into force. A city Master Plan has been recently approved
          and the Urban Conservation Plan is due to be approved within a few
          months. The General Organization for the Preservation of Historic
          Cities in Yemen (GOPHCY), established in 1990 with the aim of managing
          and safeguarding all the historic cities, is the overall authority for
          heritage preservation in Yemen. This organization should be more
          effective once the new Preservation Law is in force and its financial
          and human resources are improved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since 2000, the local branch of GOPHCY in Shibam has been supported by
          a project managed by the GIZ aimed at improving the city's overall
          physical, social and economic condition as well as undertaking
          capacity building of the GOPHCY staff branch. As a result, GOPHCY
          Shibam has been able to manage a housing rehabilitation programme that
          succeeded in documenting 98% of the traditional housing in Shibam and
          rehabilitating more than 60% of the private traditional houses. GOPHCY
          still needs more support, means and capacity building in order to be
          able to sustain long-term management.
