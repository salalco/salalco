          <h3>Visit Socotra</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Socotra, also spelled Sokotra</strong> ., Arabic Suquṭrā,
            island in the Indian Ocean about 210 miles (340 km) southeast of
            Yemen, to which it belongs. The largest of several islands extending
            eastward from the Horn of Africa, it has an area of about 1,400
            square miles (3,600 square km). The Hajīr (Hajhir) Mountains occupy
            Socotra’s interior, whereas narrow coastal plains lie in the north
            and a broader plain in the south. To the southwest and west are the
            smaller islands of Samḥah and Darzah, called al-Ikhwān (“the
            Brothers”), and ʿAbd al-Kūrī, all of which also belong to Yemen. The
            islands stand on coral banks and may once have been connected with
            the African and Arabian mainlands. Socotra’s flora includes several
            famous species, among them myrrh, frankincense, and the dragon’s
            blood tree. In recognition of its distinct plant and animal life,
            the archipelago was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2008.
          </p>

          <p>
            Socotra’s name is traced to the Sanskrit dvipa-sakhadara, “island
            abode of bliss.” The island is mentioned in various legends. The
            inhabitants long were Christians, but that religion disappeared from
            the island in the 17th century. Socotra was long ruled by the Mahra
            sultans of southeastern Yemen. Their rule on Socotra was interrupted
            by Portuguese occupation between 1507 and 1511. In 1834 the British
            tried and failed to purchase the island; in the 1880s, however, the
            sultan accepted British protection for the entire sultanate. The
            sultanate came to an end in 1967, when Socotra became part of
            independent South Yemen, and later, unified Yemen.<a

            Socotra’s sedentary inhabitants are engaged in fishing, pearl
            diving, and small-scale agriculture. In the interior, nomads keep
            cattle and other animals and raise some crops. The island’s exports
            include ghee (clarified butter), fish, and frankincense. The capital
            and largest town is Hadīboh (Tamrida) on the northern coast.

            however there is a need to strengthen the legislative framework, and
            management and enforcement capacity. Whilst the property’s
            terrestrial and marine habitats are generally still in good
            condition, management planning needs to deal more effectively with
            current threats including roading, overgrazing and overharvesting of
            terrestrial and marine natural resources. Potential future threats
            include unsustainable tourism and invasive species. Impacts of these
            threats on Socotra’s biodiversity need to be closely monitored and
            minimized. A sustainable financing strategy is required to ensure
            the necessary human and financial resources for the long term
            management of the property. Appropriate linkages need to be
            developed between the management of the property, its buffer zones
            and the Socotra Biosphere Reserve.The property is of sufficient size
            to adequately represent all the terrestrial and marine features and
            processes that are essential for the long term conservation of the
            archipelago’s rich and distinct biodiversity.
